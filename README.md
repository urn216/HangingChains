# Hanging Chains

A simple rope physics simulator for use in designing hanging rope bridges in Popular Block-Game.

Use a 2D visualiser and basic keyboard controls to pick the general shape of bridge desired, then hit 'enter' to generate a 3D model out of half-blocks.


Controls:

* Up-Arrow: raise the ending node of the bridge relative to the starting node
* Down-Arrow: lower the ending node of the bridge relative to the starting node
* Comma: decrease the tension in the rope, allowing it to hang more freely
* Period: increase the tension in the rope, reducing the amount the rope sags
* Minus: lowers the required distance between nodes, better for subtle inclines
* Equals: increases the required distance between nodes, better for extreme inclines
